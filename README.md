## Get Turning Angle 
This script operates in two selectable modes: Point mode and Connector mode

### Point Mode: an interactive mode which allows the user to
               - select a desired connector grid point
               - returns corresponding turning angle
               - prompts for next desired point selection and ruturns turning angle each time a point is selected
               - click "cancel" to exit the "Point Mode"
             
### Connector Mode: an interactive mode which allows the user to
               - to select desired set of connector(s)
               - returns maximum and minimum turning angle for each connector
               - rexecute if more connectors need to examine
               - click "cancel" to exit the "Connector Mode"

To exit script, click "Done"
